This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

## App Introduction

Many college students struggle with maintaining healthy habits while managing their academic and social lives. While many wellness apps already exist, they are often overloaded with features and don't cater to the unqiue lifestyle of college students. This application project focuses on delivering a more niche Wellness and Fitness tracker catered to college students, with features important to them specifically. Our goal is to build a simple yet useful student-centric app to help users organize and take control of their health.

## General App Overview
Users will interact with the app through inputing personal wellness data, tracking streaks and habits, and reflecting on their experiences through a diary.

## Features and Functionality
The UW Wellness Tracker includes 3 features:

- A form for entering and tracking goals, and shows progress throughout the set time duration. Units are able to be selected, such as kilograms vs. pounds, or distance traveled (miles vs. kilometer).

- Streak and Habit Tracker. This page allows the user to log and track their habits day-to-day and interact with their streaks for it. Users can enable or disable streaks (continue vs. pause), name them, or choose how they handle missing streaks (putting in a reason). Habit tracker can interact with set goals by breaking it down into habits.

- A "diary" portion where users can log their thoughts/feelings on their performance day-to-day. If progress doesn't meet set goals at the end of the day, or if habits are broken, extra prompts will be added towards the diary portion. After logging information into the form at the end of the day, the user will be prompted by the Wellness Tracker to fill out the diary portion.
