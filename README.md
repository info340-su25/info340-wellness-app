# UW Wellness Tracker - Project Proposal

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

## Overview

Many college students struggle with maintaining healthy habits while managing their academic and social lives. While many wellness apps already exist, they are often overloaded with features and don't cater to the unqiue lifestyle of college students. Our goal is to build a simple yet useful student-centric app to help users organize and take control of their health.
