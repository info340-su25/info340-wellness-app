# INFO 340 Project - UW Wellness Tracker
Aarush Sharma, Isabel Saccone, Will Feng, Altti Koskinen

This project focuses on delivering a more niche Wellness and Fitness tracker catered to college students, with features important to them specifically.
Users will input personal wellness data, visualize their progress over time, and reflect on their experiences through a diary.
All the data is also stored to allow users to view their trends across a quarter, for example.
3 features: 
Goal input and tracker over time
A graph/calendar showing trends over time
A "diary" for more specific user logs
