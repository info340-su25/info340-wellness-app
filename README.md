Aarush Sharma, Isabel Saccone, Will Feng, Altti Koskinen

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

## Overview

Many college students struggle with maintaining healthy habits while managing their academic and social lives. While many wellness apps already exist, they are often overloaded with features and don't cater to the unqiue lifestyle of college students. This project focuses on delivering a more niche Wellness and Fitness tracker catered to college students, with features important to them specifically.
Users will input personal wellness data, visualize their progress over time, and reflect on their experiences through a diary. Our goal is to build a simple yet useful student-centric app to help users organize and take control of their health.
