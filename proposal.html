      <h1>Project Proposal: UW Wellness Tracker</h1>

      <h2>Problem / Data Domain</h2>
      <p>
        College students, especially those navigating busy schedules at a large
        university like UW, often struggle to maintain consistent wellness
        habits. Sleep deprivation, poor hydration, elevated stress, and
        irregular fitness routines are common but under-tracked behaviors. While
        commercial wellness apps like
        <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/" target="_blank">MyFitnessPal</a>
        or <a href="https://daylio.net/" target="_blank">Daylio</a> exist, they
        are often too complex, bloated with features, or require integrations
        with wearable devices or subscriptions. Most importantly, they do not
        center the student experience or the daily challenges that come with
        academic life.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a clear information gap: UW students need a simple, centralized
        tool to self-track and reflect on their well-being. Our web app will
        fill this gap by providing a low-friction, privacy-centered way to
        monitor wellness metrics relevant to student life. This app aims to
        promote healthier habits, mindfulness, and data-driven reflection,
        without overwhelming the user.

      <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
      <p>
        Our application will be a wellness dashboard built for UW students. It
        will allow users to log their sleep, water intake, mood, stress, and
        exercise behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary users are college students aged 18â€“25. The interface will be
        inclusive, simple, and private. Inclusivity in our app would mean having
        accessibility features such as semantic HTML, proper color contrast, and 
        alt-text. Users will have privacy through being able to have a login to
        safeguard their personal information.

      </p>
      <p>Our interactive features will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Form for entering and tracking goals, and shows progress throughout
            the set time duration. Units are able to be selected, such as kilograms vs. pounds,
            or distance traveled (miles vs. kilometer). 
          </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A graph/calender view that shows user's wellness trends over time</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A "diary" portion where users can log their thoughts/feelings on their performance
            day-to-day. If progress doesn't meet set goals at the end of the day, extra prompts will be 
            added towards the diary portion. After logging information into the form at the end of the day, 
            the user will be prompted by the Wellness Tracker to fill out the diary portion.
          </strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All data will be user-generated and stored persistently. No external
        APIs or integrations are required, keeping the system secure and in
        scope for the class. This project will demonstrate how simple
        information design can promote personal transformation through
        consistent interaction.
