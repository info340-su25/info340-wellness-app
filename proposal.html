      <h1>Project Proposal: HuskyHealth Tracker</h1>
      <p>
        A simple, student-focused wellness tracker for sleep, diet, exercise,
        and mood.

        <h2>Problem & Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
          College students, especially those navigating busy schedules at a
          large university like UW, often struggle to maintain consistent
          wellness habits. Sleep deprivation, poor hydration, elevated stress,
          and irregular fitness routines are common but under-tracked behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
          While commercial wellness apps like
          <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/" target="_blank"
            >MyFitnessPal</a
          >
          or <a href="https://daylio.net/" target="_blank">Daylio</a> exist,
          they are often too complex, bloated with features, or require
          subscriptions. Most importantly, they do not center the student
          experience or the daily challenges that come with academic life.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a clear information gap: UW students need a simple,
          centralized tool to self-track and reflect on their well-being. Our
          web app will fill this gap by providing a way to monitor wellness
          metrics relevant to student life. This app aims to promote healthier
          habits, mindfulness, and data-driven reflection.
        </p>

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>
          Our application is a wellness dashboard built for UW students. It
          allows users to log their
          <strong>sleep, diet, exercise, and mood</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary users are college students aged 18 to 25. The interface
          will be inclusive, simple, and private. Accessibility features like
          semantic HTML, proper color contrast, and alt-text will ensure a
          better experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Privacy will be emphasized, with all data stored securely and no
          third-party integrations required.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Interactive Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Daily Log Pages</strong> – Users can log sleep, diet,
            exercise, and mood via simple forms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Streak & Habit Tracker</strong> – Users can view trends,
            track habit streaks, and see their progress visually over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Diary Section</strong> – Users can reflect on their day with
            free-form journal entries linked to their logged data.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          All data will be user-generated and stored persistently. No external
          APIs or integrations are required.
